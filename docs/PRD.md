## Product Overview

### Vision
ABBY revolutionizes online dating by eliminating the "swipe grid" entirely. Instead of browsing endless profiles, users have intimate conversations with Abby, an AI matchmaker who learns their deepest compatibility needs and finds their person. The interface feels alive - a glass pane floating over a living, bioluminescent ocean that breathes and reacts to the emotional state of the conversation.

### Target Users
**Primary:** Adults 25-45 seeking serious relationships - Professionals, divorced individuals, and people burned out on traditional dating apps who value genuine connection over casual encounters.

**Secondary:** Dating-curious individuals 22-35 - People who find traditional dating apps overwhelming or superficial but are open to AI-guided matchmaking.

### Success Metrics

| User Completion Rate | 80%+ complete the full Abby interview |
| Session Duration | Average 15+ minutes per session |
| Voice Usage | 60%+ of users engage with voice features |
| Frame Rate | Consistent 60fps during animations |
