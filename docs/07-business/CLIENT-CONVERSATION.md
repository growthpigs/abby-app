# Client Conversation: ABBY Scope Alignment

**Purpose:** Align on delivered work and formalize agreement going forward
**Tone:** Collaborative, professional, solution-oriented

---

## Opening Script

> Manuel, I wanted to give you an update on where we are with ABBY and make sure we're aligned on scope and next steps.
>
> We've completed what was originally scoped as the design system that would connect to your backend (which you mentioned was about 85% complete). The core deliverables - the VibeMatrix living shader, Abby Orb, glass UI components, and the interview flow - are all built and working.
>
> During development, to deliver a complete app experience, we also built out the full authentication system, onboarding flow, and the match/reveal screens. This means you now have 18 fully functional screens instead of the original design system scope.
>
> We're currently blocked on the backend connection because we're still waiting for API credentials and documentation. Once we have those, we can complete the integration.

---

## Framing the Scope Discussion

> To make sure we're on the same page going forward, I've put together a Statement of Work that documents what's been delivered and what's still needed. I'd like you to review it so we can formalize our agreement.
>
> The SOW also includes some standard protections for both of us - for example, if there are issues with the backend API that require debugging or fixes, that would be outside our scope since our work is the frontend integration to a working API.

## Key Points to Cover

1. **What's complete:** Design system + full app UI (delivered more than scoped)
2. **What's blocked:** Backend integration (waiting for credentials)
3. **What we need:** API credentials, documentation, test accounts
4. **What's protected:** Our scope is frontend integration, not backend debugging
5. **Going forward:** Any additional features require written approval

---

## If Asked About Cost

> The work delivered represents significant value beyond the original design system scope. Rather than discuss specific numbers right now, let's review the SOW together so you can see exactly what's been built and what we're proposing for the path forward.

---

## If Pushback on Scope Creep

> I understand. We should have caught this earlier and gotten formal approval before expanding the scope. Going forward, we have a change order process in place - any new features will be documented and approved before work begins. That protects both of us.

---

## Closing Ask

> Can you review the SOW I've prepared and let me know if you have any questions? Once we're aligned, we just need your signature and the API credentials to complete the integration.

---

## Documents to Send

1. **SOW.md** - Statement of Work with deliverables and terms
2. **Appendix A** - Screen inventory (18 screens listed)
3. **Appendix B** - Component library (11 components)

## Notes

- Don't lead with dollar amounts
- Frame as "alignment" not "you owe us"
- Emphasize value delivered
- Focus on unblocking backend integration
- Get SOW signed before further work
