# ABBY - Product Vision

**The Anti-Dating App**

---

## The Problem

Dating apps are broken. Users spend hours swiping through endless profiles, making snap judgments based on photos, only to find themselves in conversations that go nowhere. The experience is exhausting, superficial, and often dehumanizing.

**The result:** Millions of people burned out on dating apps, still looking for genuine connection.

---

## The Vision

**ABBY eliminates the swipe grid entirely.**

Instead of browsing profiles, users have intimate conversations with Abby—a warm, intelligent AI matchmaker who genuinely learns who they are and what they're looking for in a partner.

The experience feels like talking to the world's best matchmaker: someone who listens deeply, asks the right questions, and truly understands compatibility beyond surface-level attraction.

## The Experience

### 1. Meeting Abby

When users open ABBY, they don't see a grid of faces. They see Abby—a living, breathing presence inviting them into conversation. The interface feels organic, not mechanical. Colors shift and flow like a bioluminescent ocean, responding to the emotional tone of the conversation.

### 2. The Conversation

Abby guides users through a natural dialogue about relationships, values, and what matters most to them. This isn't a questionnaire—it's a conversation. Users can speak or type, and Abby responds with warmth and intelligence.

Through this dialogue, Abby learns:
- What kind of relationship they're seeking
- Their non-negotiables and deal-breakers
- The qualities that matter most in a partner
- What's worked (and hasn't) in past relationships

### 3. The Match

When Abby finds someone truly compatible, she reveals the match thoughtfully—not as a card to swipe, but as a person she believes could be meaningful in the user's life. The reveal is gradual and intentional, building anticipation and respect for the potential connection.

### 4. Beyond Matching

Abby stays with users throughout their journey. She's available to offer perspective before a first date, help process how things went afterward, and provide ongoing guidance as relationships develop.
