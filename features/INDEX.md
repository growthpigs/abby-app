**Critical Path for MVP**:
1. VibeMatrix (✅ Done)
2. AbbyOrb (✅ Done - LiquidGlass4)
3. GlassInterface (✅ Done - 28 screens)
4. Cognito Auth (✅ Done)
5. Question Flow (🚧 In Development)
6. Voice Integration (🚧 Demo Mode → Needs real API connection)

## Current Status

**Status**: MVP Implementation Nearly Complete ✅

All core MVP features are implemented. Remaining work is connecting demo mode to real API:

✅ **VibeMatrix** - Implemented & Optimized (18 shaders, registry pattern)
✅ **AbbyOrb** - Implemented (LiquidGlass4)
✅ **Glass Interface** - Implemented (28 screens)
✅ **Cognito Auth** - Implemented (email/password flow)
✅ **Settings** - Implemented (SettingsScreen)
🚧 **Question Flow** - In Development (QuestionsService exists, needs full 150 questions)
🚧 **Voice Integration** - Demo Mode (AbbyRealtimeService needs real API connection)

**Next Step**: Connect AbbyRealtimeService to real OpenAI Realtime API via client backend.

## 2026-01-07 Update (Architectural Decision: ID Token Strategy)

**What was done:**
- **Architecture Decision Approved:** Rod's iOS app will use ID tokens instead of access tokens
- **Rationale:** Nathan's backend explicitly expects ID tokens (documented in Swagger). Pragmatic approach gets system working immediately without backend changes.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low risk (can refactor to access tokens in ~2 hours if needed later)
- **Documentation Created:** `docs/05-planning/ADR-001-COGNITO-TOKEN-STRATEGY.md` (full decision record)
- **Verified Integration Points:**
  - Cognito Pool ID matches: `us-east-1_l3JxaWpl5` ✅
  - Client ID matches: `2ljj7mif1k7jjc2ajiq676fhm1` ✅
  - Backend API operational at `https://dev.api.myaimatchmaker.ai` ✅
  - Swagger documentation accessible and correct ✅
- **Test Results:** Successfully created and verified account `rodericandrews@gmail.com` with code `256453`

**Files created:**
- `docs/05-planning/ADR-001-COGNITO-TOKEN-STRATEGY.md` - Full architectural decision record

**Files updated:**
- `features/cognito-auth.md` - Updated with ID token decision and verification steps
- `docs/06-reference/RUNBOOK.md` - Added "Authentication Flow: ID Token Strategy" section
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated recent session work and dependencies
- `handover.md` - Session 2026-01-07 entry

**Key Changes to cognito-auth feature:**
- Status: 🚀 Implemented & Ready for Integration
- Login flow now specifies: Use ID token for backend API calls
- Token verification guide added
- Test account created and verified

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement ID token extraction in `AuthService.ts` (change from access token to ID token)
2. Test against real `/v1/me` endpoint
3. If successful: Continue with username/attribute fixes (given_name/family_name)
4. End-to-end test with fresh signup

**Commits pending:**
- Documentation updates (CLAUDE.md, RUNBOOK.md, handover.md)
- Feature spec updates (cognito-auth.md, INDEX.md)

## 2026-01-02 Update (Session 2: Code Hardening)

**What was done:**
- Completed P0/P1 codebase hardening: TypeScript errors → console gating → error handling
- Fixed TypeScript compilation (6 errors → 0 errors): removed legacy files, fixed props, added missing methods
- Gated 84 console statements with `__DEV__` using perl batch processing
- Fixed 3 empty catch blocks with proper DEV logging (cleanup errors)
- Timer leak fixes verified with runtime tests (398 tests pass)

**Files changed:**
- `App.tsx` - fixed PhotosScreen props, deleted App.abby.tsx (legacy ElevenLabs)
- `src/components/ui/Typography.tsx` - added numberOfLines prop
- `src/components/screens/RevealScreen.tsx` - added handleMeetCoach method
- `src/services/AbbyRealtimeService.ts` - timer tracking + cleanup logging
- `src/components/screens/CoachScreen.tsx` - cleanup error logging
- `src/components/screens/CoachIntroScreen.tsx` - cleanup error logging
- 30+ files - console statements gated with `__DEV__` check

**Quality metrics:**
- TypeScript: 6 errors → 0 errors ✅
- Console noise: 84 statements → 0 in production ✅
- Silent failures: 3 empty catches → 0 ✅
- Test coverage: 398 tests passing ✅

**Commits:**
- `e8031e8` - docs: align documentation with reality, fix TTS demo mode
- `eb65fc1` - chore: gate all console statements with __DEV__

## 2026-01-02 Update (Session 1: Autonomous Security)

**What was done:**
- Autonomous improvement session: security, tests, code quality
- Security layer added: `secureFetch.ts`, input validation, error sanitization
- Test coverage increased: 246 → 344 tests (+40%)
- Console statements gated with `__DEV__`
- All changes pushed to client-api-integration, main, staging, production

**Architecture changes:**
- Voice integration now uses OpenAI Realtime API (client backend), NOT ElevenLabs
- Authentication uses AWS Cognito (email/password), NOT phone verification
- AbbyRealtimeService replaces AbbyAgent for voice

**Feature status corrections:**
- cognito-auth: 🚀 Implemented (was 🔨 In Development)
- voice-integration: 🚧 Demo Mode (was 📝 Needs Implementation)
- settings: 🚀 Implemented (was 📝 Needs Implementation)
- glass-interface: 🚀 Implemented (was 📝 Needs Implementation)
